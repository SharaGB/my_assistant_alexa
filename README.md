## Isis Virtual Assistant
This is my simple python virtual assistant.

You can ask ***Isis*** for the current time, play your favorite music or listen to anything you want on YouTube, you can tell it to open an application like:

- [x] Google
- [x] Instagram
- [x] Facebook
- [x] Twitter
- [x] Youtube

It also has the **wikipedia module** installed so you can ask it something you want to know with the ***search*** command.

To exit the Isis voice assistant you must say ***bye***.
